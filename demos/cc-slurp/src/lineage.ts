/**
 * Fork lineage: turning a pile of session *files* into a forest of sessions.
 *
 * Forking or resuming does not reference a parent — it **copies** the inherited
 * transcript prefix into the new session's file, preserving `uuid`, `timestamp`,
 * `requestId` and `message.id` byte for byte (proposal §1.6). So the parent→child
 * edge is not written down anywhere; it has to be recovered. Two recipes:
 *
 *  1. **The marker.** From Claude Code 2.1.199, a copied record keeps its
 *     originating session in `session_id` while `sessionId` is rewritten to the
 *     containing file.
 *  2. **UUID overlap.** Before 2.1.199 there is no marker at all, so the edge
 *     must come from content: the child's file *begins* with records that also
 *     exist in the parent's file.
 *
 * **The marker names an ancestor, not necessarily the parent**, and this corpus
 * proves it. When a fork is itself forked, the second child's inherited prefix
 * ends in records the first child produced — and those are `system` / `user`
 * records, which on the builds in question carry no `session_id` at all. The last
 * *marked* record therefore still names the grandparent, and believing it turns a
 * chain into a star (`63baa90e → 4df4dbb9 → {70486150, de93c3a5}` reads as three
 * siblings of `63baa90e`). So content picks the parent whenever there is any, and
 * the marker is used to confirm it, to name a parent content cannot see, and to
 * catch the continuation case below.
 *
 * Content overlap is symmetric — "these two files share 1,575 leading records"
 * says nothing about which way the copy went — so direction needs its own
 * evidence, and this module uses three signals in order:
 *
 *  - **Length.** In a chain root→P→B, B's leading run matches more of P than of
 *    root (P's own turns are not in root), so the longest run names the *direct*
 *    parent rather than an ancestor.
 *  - **Shape.** In the child, the shared records are a contiguous prefix by
 *    construction. In the parent they usually are not: any record the fork
 *    dropped (compaction, a rewind) leaves a gap, and a fork taken mid-history
 *    puts the shared block in the middle of the parent's file. A candidate whose
 *    shared block is *not* its own leading prefix therefore cannot be the copy —
 *    it must be the original. This is the only signal that is proof rather than
 *    inference, and it is recorded as such.
 *  - **File creation order.** When both files hold the shared records as a clean
 *    leading prefix (fork with nothing dropped), content genuinely cannot tell
 *    parent from child, and the tie is broken by which file was created first.
 *    Edges resolved this way are flagged `ambiguous` — a widget that draws them
 *    identically to proven edges is lying.
 *
 * Two shapes this deliberately does **not** claim to resolve: a session forked
 * from a transcript that has since been deleted (the parent simply is not in the
 * corpus), and two siblings forked from the same point of an unmarked parent
 * that dropped nothing — content makes those look exactly like parent and child.
 * Both surface as `ambiguous` or as an unresolved reason rather than as a
 * confident edge.

 * corpus contains — a session whose every record carries `session_id` pointing
 * at an earlier session while sharing **not one uuid** with it. Claude Code
 * 2.1.220 writes it when a session is continued into a fresh file: the link is
 * real, but nothing was inherited on disk, and the child's first turn starts a
 * new cache (`cache_read = 0`) rather than re-reading the parent's context.
 *
 * The distinction matters twice over. Attribution: a continuation's records are
 * the child's own, so crediting them to `session_id` (which the marker alone
 * would do) hands a whole session's cost to its predecessor. And drawing: a copy
 * edge branches out of the middle of the parent's life, a continuation edge
 * leaves from its end.
