/**
 * Everything we know about Claude Code's transcript schema, encoded as accessor
 * functions rather than as a validating type system.
 *
 * The design bet (docs/proposals/claude-code-usage-analytics.md §5.1): Claude
 * Code ships a new build every few days and adds fields freely — 28 builds in
 * the five weeks of the baseline corpus. A validating parser turns every such
 * addition into a crash or a silent record drop. What we need instead is a
 * **lenient reader plus a loud census**: read defensively here, and let
 * `exploration/cc-usage/{census,diff}.mjs` be the thing that notices drift.
 *
 * Every accessor below obeys three rules:
 *   1. Never throw on a malformed record — return a null-ish value.
 *   2. Never assume a field exists; presence is data.
 *   3. Encode *semantics* the raw JSON does not: which fields are categorical,
 *      which are billing ground truth, which are traps.
 *
 * `Record` here is deliberately `unknown`-ish. Typing the wire format would be
 * the very mistake this module exists to avoid.
