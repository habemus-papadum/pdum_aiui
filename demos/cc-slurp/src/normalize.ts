/**
 * The normalizer: raw JSONL records → the analytic grains.
 *
 * This is where every trap in `fields.ts` is actually paid off. The order of
 * operations is load-bearing:
 *
 *   1. **Collect** every assistant record across the WHOLE corpus, keyed by
 *      `billingKey()`. Not per file, not per session — forking copies billed
 *      turns into sibling files, so anything narrower double-counts.
 *   2. **Choose** one record per key (`preferForBilling`: the member carrying
 *      the real output count; ties go to the non-sidechain copy).
 *   3. **Resolve the fork forest** (`lineage.ts`) — which session file is a copy
 *      of which, and where it branched off.
 *   4. **Attribute** each surviving turn to the session that produced it: the
 *      `session_id` marker where the build wrote one, otherwise the root-most
 *      ancestor whose file already held that record's uuid.
 *   5. **Price** over `billableUnits()` — the iterations ledger — never over
 *      top-level usage, which drops discarded fallback attempts.
 *
 * Step 3 must precede step 4, which is why lineage is resolved in `finish()`
 * rather than while streaming: on a pre-2.1.199 build an inherited record is
 * indistinguishable from a native one until the whole corpus is in memory. The
 * same reason defers *events* to `finish()` — a fork copies the parent's
 * compaction records too, so they need the same dedup-and-attribute treatment
 * turns get.
 *
 * The invariant worth asserting: `SUM(sessions.nativeCost) === corpus total`.
 * `checkInvariants()` does exactly that, and the CLI runs it every time.
