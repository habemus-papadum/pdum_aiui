/**
 * session-detail.ts — the drill-down's pure model (playbook layer 1).
 *
 * One session, turn by turn: what each turn cost, split by cost class, and how
 * big its context was. No framework, no time, no database — the SQL lands in
 * `graph.ts` and the drawing in `ui/SessionDetail.tsx`.
 *
 * ## Why the x axis is a turn ordinal and not wall-clock time
 *
 * Measured on this corpus's five priciest sessions: the largest is **92% idle**
 * over a 12.8-day span, with a **single 4.8-day gap taking 37% of the span**.
 * On a time axis its 2,183 turns collapse into a few slivers separated by
 * emptiness — the exact shape the question ("does cost per turn grow?") needs to
 * see is the part that gets squashed. Ordinal position spends every pixel on a
 * turn.
 *
 * Wall-clock is not discarded, it is demoted: each bar's tooltip carries its
 * timestamp, and `gaps()` marks where the session was put down and picked up
 * again, so "I came back to this a week later" is still legible.
 *
 * ## Context size is derived, not stored
 *
 * No field says how big the context was. The tokens *sent up* on a turn are the
 * next best thing — cache read + cache creation + fresh input — and that is
 * checkable, because a compaction records its own `preTokens`. Against the 40
 * compactions in this corpus the proxy lands **within ±20% on 38**, most within
 * 2%.
 *
 * The two misses are both `hadFallback` turns, and they read ~2.2× high for a
 * reason worth keeping: a fallback re-sends the whole context to the second
 * model, so the turn's summed tokens legitimately count it twice. That is 2
 * turns in 21,583 (0.01%), so the series is honest as drawn — but a turn marked
 * `hadFallback` is showing transmitted tokens, not context size.

/**

 * makes concrete. In the priciest session the median turn costs $0.37 while 2%
