/**
 * timeline-client.ts — the session graph as a first-class Mosaic client.
 *
 * This is the seam where the timeline meets the crossfilter. It is a real
 * `MosaicClient`, not a chart that happens to read a signal, and it plays both
 * roles a crossfilter participant can play:
 *
 *  - **Consumer.** `filterBy` is the shared `Selection`; the coordinator calls
 *    `query(predicate)` whenever anyone's clause changes and hands the rows to
 *    `queryResult`, which pushes them into a durable Solid signal. From there
 *    it is pure Solid — layout (timeline.ts) and SVG.
 *  - **Producer.** Brushing the time axis calls `publish`, which puts a
 *    `clauseInterval` into the same Selection. Every other client re-queries.
 *
 * Why a custom client rather than stock vgplot marks: the vertical position of
 * every mark is a *lane*, and lanes are computed by packing the result set that
 * comes back — they are a property of the query result, not a column in it. A
 * mark's `y` channel can only name a column or a constant, so a stock mark
 * would need the lane materialised in SQL (an interval-graph coloring, i.e. a
 * recursive CTE re-run on every brush) and would still have nowhere to put the
 * fork beziers, whose endpoints are two different rows' lanes. `queryResult` is
 * the hook that exists precisely for "I will do my own rendering", so that is
 * the one we use.
 *
 * One query, three row kinds, one round trip — `kind` discriminates sessions,
 * agents, and fork edges. Expanding or collapsing anything is pure layout and
 * never comes back here.
