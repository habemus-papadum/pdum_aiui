/**
 * electron/main.mjs — the Electron main process, in both of its shapes.
 *
 * ONE file, two ways in, and which one is live is decided by a single fact:
 *
 *   CC_MINER_URL set    DEV. A window onto the Vite server electron/dev.mjs
 *                       started. HMR, source maps, the whole iteration loop.
 *   CC_MINER_URL unset  PACKAGED. A window onto `app://cc-miner/`, served out
 *                       of `dist/` by electron/app-scheme.mjs.
 *
 * The renderer is the same build either way, and it is never told which of the
 * two it is in. `src/host.ts` answers "am I in Electron?" at runtime, and
 * nothing answers "am I packaged?" at all, because nothing above this file is
 * allowed to care. That is what makes "it runs the same in a tab and in a
 * window" a claim someone can check rather than a hope.
 *
 * Deliberately still absent: preload, IPC, a menu. Every one of them is a place
 * where the packaged app could start behaving differently from the browser one.
 * The transport between renderer and data is HTTP in all three hosts.
 *
 *   CC_MINER_URL        dev server URL — presence selects dev mode
 *   CC_MINER_CDP_PORT   Chrome DevTools Protocol port, "" to disable
 *   CC_MINER_DEVTOOLS   "1" to open DevTools detached on start
