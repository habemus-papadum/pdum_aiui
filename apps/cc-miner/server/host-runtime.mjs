/**
 * host-runtime.mjs — how anything finds the DuckDB host.
 *
 * ONE route, `GET /__duckdb-host`, mounted in three places:
 *
 *   `pnpm dev`       Vite dev server        → server/vite-plugin.ts
 *   `pnpm preview`   Vite preview server    → server/vite-plugin.ts
 *   the packaged app Electron `app://`      → electron/app-scheme.mjs
 *
 * ── Why there is no `/quack` proxy any more ──────────────────────────────────
 * There used to be one, to keep the host's port out of the client. It could not
 * survive the packaged app, and the reason is worth recording because it is a
 * design lesson rather than a bug: the client built its endpoint as
 * `quack:${location.host}/quack`. Under `http://localhost:5191` that is right.
 * Under `app://cc-miner/` it becomes `quack:cc-miner/quack` — a hostname DuckDB
 * dials over TCP, never touching the custom scheme. The renderer was **deriving
 * an assumption about its own origin**, and the assumption was false in one
 * host. It failed by hanging with no request and no error.
 *
 * So the origin now TELLS the page where the data is, and the page uses it
 * verbatim. Measured, and the reason the proxy is not merely relocated:
 * `quack_serve` answers `OPTIONS` with `access-control-allow-origin: *`,
 * `-headers: *`, `-methods: GET, POST, OPTIONS`, so a direct cross-origin POST
 * works from an http page, from `app://`, and from inside a worker via the
 * synchronous XHR duckdb-wasm actually uses.
 *
 * The port still appears in no client code. It arrives from a lookup — which is
 * exactly what deployment-shapes.md §1.9 asks for. What it warns against is a
 * *hardcoded* port, which fails silently when contended.
 *
 * Plain `.mjs`, not TypeScript, for one reason: the Electron main process runs
 * this file as-is out of a packaged bundle, where there is no transpiler. The
 * types are JSDoc so `tsconfig.node.json` still checks it.
