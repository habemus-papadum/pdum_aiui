/**
 * duckdb.ts — this app's DuckDB-WASM bundle wiring. The instantiation dance and
 * the byte-progress fetch graduated to `@habemus-papadum/aiui-viz/duckdb`; what
 * stays here is exactly what a library can't own: the `?url` asset imports,
 * which make Vite emit the wasm/worker files as first-class assets of THIS app,
 * served from its own origin under its own base (dev: `/`, build: `/aiui/`) —
 * no jsDelivr at runtime on a static-S3 deploy. See NOTES.md.
 *
 * Only `mvp` + `eh` (no `coi`): the threaded bundle needs COOP/COEP headers
 * plain S3 can't set. `selectBundle` picks `eh` on every modern browser.
